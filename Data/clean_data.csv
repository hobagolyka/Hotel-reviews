good, Had an upgrade for city views at a price and wasn t worth it the extra Could just about sea a few building tops and a great big office block being built  Great location clean and tidy staff were top notch Wish I could of stopped longer to do more in the hotel 
good, Bit out of the way of some of the main shopping strips but there are alot of nice eateries and bars close by  Cozy rooms good value for money 
good, The shower maybe as the water pressure wasn t that good  Room is spacious Staff are friendly concierge team are very efficient and can help you booking all sorts of attractions and theatre tickets Location is excellent you can reach London eye the parliament and Buckingham Palace on foot within minutes Bus stop and underground are few minutes from the hotel Decor and atmosphere is really great Breakfast is good too 
good, Breakfast was really good but had to cue and the restaurant didn t seem big enough for the amount of guests Reception and bar were very nice but the rooms could do with a revamp but they were clean and comfortable just dated  Hotel was really buzzing from the moment we arrived 11am on saturday until we left on the sunday
good, The service and hotel was absolutely fantastic
good, tiny tiny room 
good, General feeling of the hotel great choice of food for breakfast
good, The minibar is placed in the wardrobe the heat discharge from the minibar builds up in the wardrobe and feels like a hazard with the heat building in the wardrobe this is something that facilities housekeeping may consider looking into Room sizes are small for the price this is generally true for Paris as a whole so not a specific to the hotel  This was our first experience with a boutique hotel and overall it was very pleasant and we have no hesitation in recommending this hotel Some of the things we particularly liked are Staff are very friendly attentive and are willing to help the guests to their utmost Property is managed really well and is clean and welcoming including housekeeping of the room and toilette Personally we loved the minimalist design and decor extensive use of white and grey with very clean lines which does make the rooms feel bigger and airy than they generally are 
good, Staff made your stay here special from the handwritten welcome note to the specially prepared cocktails by Tom it was an absolute pleasure to stay here would definitely recommend 
good, Nice traditional hotel good location near DLR comfort room
